# Let's do some React Native 


## Software requirements:

* [Xcode 6.4](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/)
* [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)
* Node: `brew install node`
* Watchman: `brew install watchman`
* React Native command line: `npm install -g react-native-cli`

## Then:

* Get this repo: `git clone git@github.com:meetup/react-native-demo.git`
* Change to directory `cd react-native-demo`
* Install required npm packages `npm install`
* Open it in Xcode `open rndemo.xcodeproj`
* Hit the "play" button in the upper left of Xcode, or hit ⌘R

The project should run in the iOS simulator. If you get stuck, ping Rick on HipChat.

If you'd like to start experimenting, open up the react-native-demo directory in a text editor (not Xcode). A good place to start is demo.ios.js -- that's the component that is being loaded as the start screen.
